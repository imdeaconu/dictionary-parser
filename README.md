# Dictionary Parser

A tiny project that makes use of various dictionary APIs (currently there are providers for Wiktionary and local data). I created this in order to learn more about Test Driven Development and Domain Driven Desogn. 




## Roadmap

- Add a controller to make requests via a web API
- Update the Wiktionary provider to fetch example images and pronunciations 


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/imdeaconu/dictionary-parser
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd dictionary-parser
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Run the Wiktionary Provider example

```bash
  npm run start-wiktionary
```

Run the InMemory example

```bash
  npm run start-in-memory
```
